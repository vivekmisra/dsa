	 * Bubble sort is by using a flag in a while loop to determine if the given
	 * list is sorted or not. Each loop will bubble up the largest
	 * value(smallest value for descending order) of the remaining unsorted
	 * elements to the correct position. Bubble up means the swap of two values,
	 * when looping through each element in the list, if the value of the
	 * current position is larger than the value of the next position, swap them
	 * and set the swapped flag to true, so that the next outer while loop will
	 * loop through list again to do the next round of bubbling. Each inner loop
	 * will bubble up one value to the correct position, thus the number of
	 * inner loops will decrease by 1 in the next iteration.
